Network Protocols
- In computer networks, hosts communicate with each other through the use of network protocols.
- Network protocols ensure that different computer systems, using different hardware and software can communicate with each other.
- There are a large number of network protocols used by different services for different objectives/functionality.
- Communication between different hosts via protocols is transferred/facilitated through the use of packets.

Packets
- The primary goal of networking is the exchange of information between networked computers; this information is transferred by packets.
- Packets are nothing but streams of bits running as electric signals on physical media used for data transmission (Ethernet, Wi-Fi etc.).
- These electrical signals are then interpreted as bits (zeroes and ones) that make up the information.
- Every packet in every protocol has the following structure:

- The header has a protocol-specific structure: this ensure that the receiving host can correctly interpret the payload and handle the overall communication.
- The payload is the actual information being sent. It could be something like a part of an email message or the content of a file during a download.

The OSI Model
- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing systems into seven abstraction layers.
- It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to facilitate communication between different systems and devices, ensuing interoperability and understanding across a wide range of networking technologies.
- The OSI model is divided into seven layers, each representing a specific functionality in the process of network communication.

- The OSI model serves as a guideline for developing and understanding network protocols and communication processes.
- While it is a conceptual model, it helps in organizing the complex task of network communication into manageable and structured layers.
- Note: The OSI model is not a strict blueprint for every networking system but rather a reference model that aids in understanding and designing network architecture.
