MSF Architecture
- ![[Pasted image 20241224074547.png]]
- A module in the context of MSF, is a piece of code that can be utilized by the MSF.
- The MSF libraries facilitate the execution of modules without having to write the code necessary in order to execute them. (Like shared objects on Linux or DLLs on Windows), libraries allow you to extend functionality, or contain the code required to initiate or extend the functionality. (For example setting up a TCP socket etcetra.)

MSF Modules
- Exploit: A module that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability and is typically paired with a payload.
- Payload: Code that is delivered by the MSF and remotely executed on the target after successful exploitation. An example of a payload is a reverse shell that initiates a connection from the target system back to the attacker.
- Encoder: Used to encode payloads in order to avoid AV detection, for example `shikata_ga_nai` is used to encode Windows payloads.
- NOPS: Used to ensure that payload sizes are consistent and ensure the stability of a payload when executed.
- Auxiliary: A module that is used to perform additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration. An auxiliary module is essentially any module that cannot be paired with a payload.

MSF Payload Types
- When working with exploits, MSF provides you with to types of payloads that can be paired with an exploit:
	- Non-Staged Payload: A payload that is sent to the target system as a whole with the exploit.
	- Staged Payload: A staged payload is sent to the target in two parts, whereby:
		- The first part (stager) contains a payload that is used to establish a reverse connection back to the attacker, download the second part of the payload (stage) and execute it. The stage is responsible for either executing arbitrary commands on the target system, or for providing us with a reverse shell or meterpreter session.

Stagers and Stages
- Stagers: Stagers are typically used to establish a stable communication channel between the attacker and target, after which a stage payload is downloaded and executed on the target system.
- Stage: Payload components that are downloaded by the stager.

Meterpreter Payload
- The meterpreter (Meta-Interpreter) payload is an advanced multi-functional payload that is executed in memory on the target system making it difficult to detect. This payload is not executed on disk, it is executed in memory, and as such, no traces are left on the target system, which works well for avoiding detection.
- It communicates over a stager socket and provides an attacker with an interactive command interpreter on the target system that facilitates the execution of system commands, file system navigation, keylogging and much more.

MSF File System Structure
- The MSF file system is organized in a simple and easy to understand format and is organized into various directories.
- The MSF File system can be accessed at the `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/` directory.

MSF Module Locations
- MSF stores modules under the following directory on Linux systems: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/`
- User specified modules are stored under the following directory on Linux systems: `~/.ms4/modules/`

Practical Demonstration
- Look up MSFconsole modules directory structure: `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules`
- Custom Modules can be loaded in the following directory: `/home/kali/.msf4/modules`
