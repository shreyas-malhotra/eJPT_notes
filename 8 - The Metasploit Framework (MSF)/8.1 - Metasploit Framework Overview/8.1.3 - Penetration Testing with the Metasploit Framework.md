Penetration testing with MSF
- The MSF can be used to perform and automate various tasks that fall under the penetration testing lifecycle.
- In order to understand how we can leverage the MSF for penetration testing, we need to explore the various phases of a penetration test and their respective techniques and objectives.
- We can adopt the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) as a roadmap to understanding the various phases that make up a penetration test and how Metasploit can be integrated in to each phase.

Penetration Testing Execution Standard
- The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is a penetration testing methodology that was developed by a team of information security practitioners with the aim of addressing the need for a comprehensive and up-to-date standard for penetration testing.
