- Usage Example: `smbmap -u "administrator" -p "smbserver_771" -H 10.10.0.1`
- The `-u` flag here is used to provide the username (which, if omitted a null session is assumed).
- The `-p` flag is used to provide a password or NTLM hash for authentication (in the case of guest login, we can just use `-p ""`).
- The `-d` flag is used to provide the domain name (default value is WORKGROUP).
- The `-H` flag is used to provide the target host. 
- We can try to run a command using the `-x` flag.
- For example, `smbmap -u "administrator" -p "smbserver_771" -H 10.10.0.1 -x "ipconfig"`
- The `-L` flag lists all shares present on the specified host, it needs admin rights to perform this operation.
- The `-r` flag is used for getting a detailed view of the directory structure of a specific share on the target host.
- The `--upload` flag can be used to upload a file to the target host.
- Usage Example: `smbmap -H 10.10.0.1 -u "administrator" -p "smbserver_771" --upload "/root/backdoor" "C$\backdoor"`
- The `--download` flag can be used to download a file from the target host.
- Usage Example: `smbmap -H 10.10.0.1 -u "administrator" -p "smbserver_771" --download "C$\flag.txt"`
