- After the host discovery and port scanning phase of a penetration test, the next logical phase is going to be service enumeration.
- The goal of service enumeration is to gather more detailed information about the hosts on a network and the services running on them.
- This includes information like account names, shares, misconfigured services and so on.
- Like the scanning phase, enumeration involves active connections to the remote target hosts on a network.
- There are many protocols on a networked systems that an attacker can target if they have been misconfigured or have been left enabled.
- In this section of the course, we will be exploring the various tools and techniques that can be used to interact with these protocols, with the intent of eventually exploiting them in the later phases.
