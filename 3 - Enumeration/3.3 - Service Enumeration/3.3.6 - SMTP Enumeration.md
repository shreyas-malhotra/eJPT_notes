- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that is used for the transmission of email.
- SMTP uses port 25/tcp by default. It can also be configured to run on port 465/tcp and 587/tcp, if SSL/TLS is configured.
- We can utilize auxiliary modules to enumerate the version of SMTP as well as user accounts on the target system.
- SMTP by itself is not generally exploited, but the purpose of demonstrating SMTP enumeration is so that the information gained during the process, can be used to exploit other services like SSH more effectively.

Practical Demonstration
	- `service postgresql start`
	- `msfconsole`
	- `workspace -a smtp_enum`
	- `setg RHOST demo.ine.local`
	- `setg RHOSTS demo.ine.local`
	- SMTP Version and Domain Name Enumeration
		- `search type:auxiliary name:smtp`
		- `use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version`
		- `options`
		- `run`
	- SMTP User Enumeration
		- `search type:auxiliary name:smtp`
		- `use /auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum`
		- `info`
		- `options`
		- `set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt`
		- `run`
