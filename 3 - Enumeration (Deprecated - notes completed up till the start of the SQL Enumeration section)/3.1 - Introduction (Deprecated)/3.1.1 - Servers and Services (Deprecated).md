- A server is a computer that "serves" something to a user. Essentially, It provides some sort of functionality, specialized to that machine, that can be utilized from other devices.
- A server could be running an operating system like Windows Server, Linux, MacOS Server or BSD. Technically any computer could be a server, depending on how it is configured.
- In large environments, resources like file storage, email, and administrative control are pooled together in specialized computers known as servers.
- Pooling resources works so that multiple workstations can access the same features.
- Servers by their very nature need to be accessed remotely.
- The services running on a server require opening up a listening port and accepting connections remotely.
- These listening ports can be exploited for remote access to the whole system, by exploiting inherent bugs, flaws, features and misconfiguration present on the server.
