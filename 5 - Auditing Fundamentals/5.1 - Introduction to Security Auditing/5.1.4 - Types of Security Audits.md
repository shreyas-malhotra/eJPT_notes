- Security audits can be categorized based on their scope, methodology, and the aspects of the organization they focus on.
- For penetration testers, understanding these different types of security audits is crucial to tailor their testing strategies effectively.

Types of Security Audits
	- Internal Audits
		- Objective: Conducted by the organization's internal audit team or security professionals to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with policies.
		- Importance: Internal audits provide insights into the organization's self-assessment of its security posture and highlights areas that may require more in depth testing.
		- Example: An internal audit might review user access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.
	- External Audits
		- Objective: Performed by independent third-party auditors to provide an unbiased evaluation of the organization's security measures and compliance with external standards.
		- Importance: External audits often serve ad benchmarks for compliance and security effectiveness. Penetration testers can use these findings to guide their testing efforts.
		- Example: A company undergoing a PCI DSS compliance audit might hire an external auditor to validate its security controls and ensure they meet the required standards.
	- Compliance Audits
		- Objective: Focus on verifying that the organization complies with specific regulatory requirements and industry standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
		- Importance: Compliance audits help identify regulatory gaps that penetration testers can address through targeted testing.
		- Example: A healthcare provider might undergo a HIPAA compliance audit to ensure that the patient data is protected according to federal requirements.
	- Technical Audits
		- Objective: Focus on assessing the technical aspects of the organization's IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network configurations.
		- Importance: Technical audits provide a detailed view of the technical controls in place, highlighting areas where penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities.
		- Example: A technical audit might involve a thorough review  of firewall configurations to ensure they are properly securing the network perimeter.
	- Network Audits
		- Objective: Assess the security of the organization's network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices.
		- Importance: Network audits can reveal vulnerabilities in network design and configurations that penetration testers can exploit to assess network security.
		- Example: A network audit might identify insecure protocols being used for data transmission, prompting penetration testers to test for potential exploits.
	- Application Audits
		- Objective: Evaluate the security of software applications, focusing on code quality, input validation, authentication mechanisms and data handling.
		- Importance: Application audits highlight security flaws in applications that penetration testers can exploit to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios.
		- Example: An application audit might reveal vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting in a web application.
