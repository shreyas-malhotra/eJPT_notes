- In order for you to operate successfully as a penetration tester, it is imperative that you understand when, how and why Security Audits are performed and how they relate to and affect penetration testing.
- The reason this is important is because Security Audits and Penetration Testing are two separate types of security assessments that have their own unique scope, objectives and desired outcomes.
- Furthermore, given the separation, it is important to understand when each is performed (sequentially), and whether they can be combined into a singular process/assessment.
- Before we dive into the when and how, we first need to understand the differences between a Security Audit and a Penetration Test, more specifically, the differences in the objectives, scope and outcomes.
- Understanding the differences between the two will paint a clearer picture as to when each assessment is performed and how they (potentially) feed into each other.

- Security Audit
	- Purpose: Evaluate an organization's overall security posture by assessing compliance with policies, standards, and regulations. It focuses on the effectiveness of security controls, processes, and practices.
	- Scope: Comprehensive, covering various aspects such as policies, procedures, technical controls, physical security, and compliance with regulations.
	- Methodology: Typically involves reviewing documentation, conducting  interviews, performing technical assessments, and evaluating compliance with security standards.
	- Outcome: Identifies gaps in security policies, procedures, and controls. Provides recommendation for improving overall security and ensuring compliance.
	- Frequency: Often performed on a regular basis (e.g. annually or biannually) or as required by compliance regulations.
- Penetration Test
	- Purpose: Simulate real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. It focuses on technical weaknesses and how they can be exploited by attackers.
	- Scope: Specific to the systems, networks or applications being tested. The scope is defined to focus on particular areas of interest.
	- Methodology: Involves using various tools and techniques to attempt to breach systems, exploit vulnerabilities, and assess the effectiveness of security defenses.
	- Outcome: Provides a detailed assessment of vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. Offers recommendations for mitigating identified risks and improving security defenses.
	- Frequency: Typically performed as needed, such as after significant changes to systems, on a regular schedule, or as a part of compliance requirements.

- Approaches to Security Testing
	- Sequential Approach
			- Perform Security Audit First: Companies often conduct a security audit first to evaluate their overall security posture, ensure compliance with regulations, and identify areas for improvement in policies and procedures.
			- Conduct Penetration Test Afterwards: Based on the findings of the audit, a penetration test may be performed to assess the effectiveness of technical controls and identify specific vulnerabilities.
		- Advantages:
			- Provides a comprehensive view of security from both policy and technical perspectives.
			- Identifies and addresses gaps in both procedural and technical controls.
			- Helps prioritize remediation efforts based on audit findings.
	- Combined or Hybrid Approach
			- Integrate Security Audit and Penetration Testing: Some organizations choose to combine security audits and penetration tests, often through a holistic security assessment that incorporates both elements.
		- Advantages:
			- Streamlining the assessment process by combining policy, procedural, and technical evaluations.
			- Provides a more complete picture of the organization's security posture in a single engagement.
			- Can be more efficient and cost-effective by addressing both compliance and technical vulnerabilities simultaneously.

Example: Sequential Approach
	- Consider a fictional organization, "SecurePayments Inc.", which processes credit card transactions and must adhere to PCI DSS standards.
	- In this example, "SecurePayments Inc." is using a sequential approach to assess their overall security posture. The organization has already performed a security audit through an independent audit firm and are using the findings in the audit report as the basis of their remediation plan/efforts.
	- As part of their remediation plan, the organization has decided to hire you to perform a penetration test with a focus on ensuring PCI DSS compliance.
	- The external audit performed by the independent audit firm outlined the following findings:
		- Inadequate encryption for cardholder data in transit.
		- Weak/inadequate network security controls and traffic monitoring.
		- Weak access control policies that allow excessive permissions.
		- Outdated incident response procedures.
	- The corresponding recommendations for the findings outlined above are:
		- Implement strong encryption protocols for data in transit.
		- Revise access control policies to follow the principle of least privilege.
		- Update and test incident response procedures regularly.
	- The company followed the Security Audit lifecycle/process outlined in the "Security Auditing Process/Lifecycle" video and made the necessary improvements based on the recommendations.

Example: SecurePayments Inc., Penetration Test
	- Objectives: After making the necessary changes/improvements based on the findings and recommendations in the external audit report, "SecurePayments Inc." has hired you to test the technical controls and security measures implemented based on audit findings to verify whether they are effective.
	- Phase 1: Planning and Preparation:
		- During the initial phase, you identify that the PCI DSS scope includes the cardholder data environment (CDE). You review SecurePayments Inc.'s network diagrams and PCI DSS self-assessment questionnaires to understand the current security measures and compliance status.
		- Objectives: 
			- Define the scope of the penetration test to focus on areas identified in the audit, such as network security and application vulnerabilities.
			- Set up a testing schedule and inform stakeholders.
	- Phase 2: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance:
		- You gather information on SecurePayments Inc.'s security policies, such as their access control policies, encryption standards, and incident response procedures.
		- You also review their most recent PCI DSS audit report to identify areas of concern highlighted by auditors.
	- Phase 3: Penetration Test Execution
		- Conduct network scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
		- Attempt exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact.
		- Test the effectiveness of newly implemented encryption and access controls.
	- Phase 4: Findings and Recommendations
		- Outcome: The Penetration Test uncovers additional vulnerabilities:
			- An exposed administrative interface that allows unauthorized access.
			- SQL injection vulnerabilities in a customer-facing web application.
		- Recommendations:
			- Secure the administrative interface by implementing additional authentication and access controls.
			- Patch the SQL injection vulnerabilities and conduct a thorough review of application security.
	- Security Audit Results:
		- Identified compliance gaps and policy deficiencies.
		- Provided recommendations for improving security policies and procedures.
	- Penetration Testing Results:
		- Revealed specific technical vulnerabilities.
		- Offered targeted recommendations to address the technical weaknesses.
