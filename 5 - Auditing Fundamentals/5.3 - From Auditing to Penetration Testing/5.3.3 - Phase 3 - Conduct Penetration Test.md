Phase 3 - Conducting a Penetration Test
	- Objective: To validate the effectiveness of remediation actions through a penetration test, ensuring that the Linux server is secure and compliant with the security policy.
	- Step 1 - Execution
		- Network Scan: Use Nmap to identify open ports and services.
		- Vulnerability Scanning: Use Metasploit to find and exploit vulnerabilities.
		- Web Application Testing: Use Burp Suite to test web applications, if applicable.
	- Step 2 - Validating Remediation
		- Compare Results: Compare initial audit findings with penetration test results to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed.
		- Check for new vulnerabilities: Identify and remediate any new vulnerabilities introduced during the remediation phase.
	- Step 3 - Reporting
		- Executive Summary: Provide an overview of the penetration test and major findings.
		- Methodology: Detail the tools and techniques used during the test.
		- Findings: Describe vulnerabilities found, including severity and potential impact.
		- Recommendations: Offer steps to further secure the system.

Practical Demonstration
	- `hydra -l root -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt ssh://178.79.173.229:22 -t 4 -v`
	- Potential remediation steps:
		- `nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf`
		- `sudo ufw status`
		- `sudo apt install fail2ban`
