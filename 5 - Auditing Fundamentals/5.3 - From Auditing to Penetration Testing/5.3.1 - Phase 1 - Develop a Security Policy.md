- We will use a practical example to explain and demonstrate how security audits work, how they are performed and how they relate to a penetration test.
- The objective of this section is to provide you with tacit knowledge of how results from security audits affect the objectives and scope of a penetration test, in addition to outlining the changes/adaptations that need to be made while performing a pentest for an organization that is required to comply with specific standards or regulations.

Practical Demonstration
- Background:
	- Company: SecureTech Solutions
- Description:
	- SecureTech Solutions is a fictitious cybersecurity consultancy that specializes in securing IT infrastructure for various clients.
	- In this example, we will be demonstrating the process of developing a security policy for Linux servers, performing a risk assessment using the NIST SO 800-53 framework, performing a security audit and testing the remediations.
	- This example will guide you through the entire process, from initial policy creation to auditing and penetration testing, highlighting the importance of compliance with industry standards.

Phase 1 - Developing a Security Policy
- Objectives:
	- Establish a baseline security policy for Linux servers that align with NIST SP 800-53 guidelines, ensuring that servers are configured and managed securely.
	- This policy should ensure that Linux servers are secure and protected from unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and other security threats.
	- It will be used to establish baseline security requirements for configuring, maintaining, and monitoring Linux servers within the organization, aligned with NIST SP 800-53.
- Security Policy Development Process: Requirements Gathering
	- Purpose: Define the purpose and scope of the security policy.
	- Access Control: Outline user account management, authentication methods, and privilege management.
	- Audit and Accountability: Specify logging requirements and log review procedures.
	- Configuration Management: Define baseline configurations, software update practices, and change management.
	- Identification and Authentication: Enforce strong password policies and unique user identification.
	- System and Information Integrity: Implement malware protection, security monitoring, and vulnerability management.
	- Maintenance: Outline controlled maintenance and approved maintenance tools.
