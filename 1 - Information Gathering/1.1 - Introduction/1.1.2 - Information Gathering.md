There are several ways to perform Information Gathering, the information available can have different importance to the pen-tester based on what kind of pentest is being performed.
	- For example if the pentest to be conducted is a web pentest:
		- The primary objective is to learn more about the website itself, what web technologies are being utilized by the developer, If there are any publicly known vulnerabilities present on the technology stack used by the website, IP address of the server hosting the website
	- In case the pentest to be conducted is an internal network pentest:
		- Information about web servers may primarily be utilized to gain access to internal network
		- Information about the employees (names, email addresses) could be used for performing phishing attacks instead of alternatively trying to pivot from web server.

Active Information Gathering = Actively engaging w the target system to gain more info, ex: Nmap scans on publicly available IP addresses (requires authorization)
- open ports
- internal infrastructure
- enumerating information
