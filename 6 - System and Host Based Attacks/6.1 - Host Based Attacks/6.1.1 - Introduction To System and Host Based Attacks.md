What are System/Host based attacks?
- System/Host based attacks are attacks that are targeted towards a specific system or host running a specific operating system, for example, Windows or Linux.
- Network services are not the only attack vector that can be targeted during a penetration test.
- System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained access to a target network, whereby, you will be required to exploit servers, workstations or laptops on the internal network.

System/Host based attacks
- System/Host based attacks are primarily focused on exploiting inherent vulnerabilities on the target OS.
- Unlike network based attacks, host based attacks are much more specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system and the vulnerabilities that affect the said operating systems.
- System/Host based attacks involve exploiting misconfigurations and inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS.
- In this curse, we will primarily be focusing on Windows and Linux vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.
