- The Windows OS stores hashed user account passwords locally in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database.
- Hashing is the process of converting a piece of data into another value. A hashing function or algorithm is used to generate a new value. The result of a hashing algorithm is known as a hash or a hash value.
- Authentication and verification of user credentials is facilitated by the Local Security Authority (LSA).
- Windows versions up to Windows Server 2003 utilize two different types of hashes:
	- LM
	- NTLM
- Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing from Windows Vista onwards.

SAM Database
- SAM (Security Account Manager) is a database file that is responsible for managing user accounts and passwords on Windows. All user account passwords stored in the SAM database are hashed.
- The SAM database file cannot be copied while the operating system is running.
- The Windows NT kernel keeps the SAM database file locked and as a result, attackers typically use in-memory techniques and tools to dump SAM hashes from the LSASS process.
- In modern versions of Windows, the SAM database is encrypted with a syskey.
- Note: Elevated/Administrative privileges are required in order to access and interact with the LSASS process.

LM Hash (LanMan Hash)
- LM is the default hashing algorithm that was implemented in Windows operating systems prior to NT 4.0.
- The protocol is used to hash user passwords, and the hashing process can be broken down into the following steps:
	- The password is broken down into two seven-character chunks.
	- All characters are then converted into uppercase.
	- Each chunk is then hashed separately with the DES algorithm.
- LM hashing is generally considered to be a weak protocol and can easily be cracked, primarily because the password hash does not include salts, consequently making brute-force and rainbow table attacks effective against LM hashes.

NTLM (NTHash)
- NTLM is a collection of authentication protocols that are utilized in Windows to facilitate authentication between computers. The authentication process involves using a valid username and password to authenticate successfully.
- It is not be confused with NTLMv1 and NTLMv2.
- From Windows Vista onwards, Windows disables LM hashing and utilizes NTLM hashing.
- When a user account is created, its password is encrypted using the MD4 hashing algorithm and then is disposed of.
- NTLM improves upon LM in the following ways:
	- Does not split the hash in to two chunks.
	- Case sensitive.
	- Allows the use of symbols and unicode characters.
- The generation of NTLM hashes, does not use salting during the password hashing process. This makes them susceptible to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
