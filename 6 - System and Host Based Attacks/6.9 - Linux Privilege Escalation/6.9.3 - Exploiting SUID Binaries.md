- In addition to the three main file access permissions (read, write and execute), Linux also provides users with specialized permissions that can be utilized in specific situations. One of these specialized access permissions is the SUID (Set Owner User ID) permission.
- When applied, this permission provides users with the ability to execute a script or binary with the permission of the file owner as opposed to the user that is running the script or binary.
- SUID permissions are typically used to provide unprivileged users with the ability to run specific scripts or binaries with "root" permissions. It is to be noted, however, that the provision of elevate privileges is limited to the execution of the script and does not translate to elevation of privileges, however, if improperly configured, unprivileged users can exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within the binary or script to obtain an elevated session.

Example of a SUID Binary
- We can imagine a binary on Linux that allows standard users to execute specific commands, scripts or binaries with root privileges, one of these binaries is the `sudo` binary, the user using the sudo command to execute a specific command with elevated privileges needs to provide the appropriate credentials, and be a part of the sudoers group, to be able to use it.
- The sudo binary itself is owned by the root user, and is an SUID binary, such that it allows unprivileged users to execute the specified binary with the binary's owner, root's privileges.
- Its to be noted that the provision of elevated privileges is limited to the execution of the specified script or binary, executing a SUID binary does not provide one with free reigns as the root user, it just allows us to execute the specified file, command or script as the root user.

Exploiting SUID Binaries
- We can find specific misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in how the SUID binaries are configured, and if there are vulnerabilities in the SUID binary that can be exploited, we can get that SUID binary to execute specific commands with root privileges consequently providing us with an elevated session.
- This is the functionality that we will be attempting to exploit in order to elevate our privileges, however, the success of our attack will depend on the following factors:
	- Owner of the SUID binary - Given that we are attempting to elevate our privileges, we will only be exploiting SUID binaries that are owned by the "root" user or other privileged users.
	- Access permissions - We will require executable permissions in order to execute the SUID binary.

Practical Demonstration
- `whoami`
- `groups student`
- `pwd`
- We are currently in the home directory of the student user, and the student user does not have any sudo or root privileges.
- `ls -al`
- Upon listing the contents of the current directory, we observe that there are two binaries present in the current directory, `greetings` and `welcome`.
- The `welcome` binary has the file permissions set to `-rwxsr-xr-x`, and is executable by everyone. The `s` bit in the file permissions denote that the SUID permission is set for this file. SUID being set here denotes that the file is executable as the file owner, which is the root user in this case.
- `./greetings`
- The `greetings` binary is not executable by us, so it is not a valid way of exploitation regardless of the SUID file permission status.
- `./welcome`
- The `welcome` binary is executable by us and prints a welcome message to the terminal screen.
- `file welcome` tells us that the `welcome` binary is a standard ELF binary for Linux, it also tells us the shared objects being loaded by the binary, which could be a way method of exploitation if we are able to find missing shared objects, we can create our own shared objects and get the `welcome` binary to load it and execute a malicious payload.
- `strings welcome` will give us a list of the strings present within the binary.
- The `so.x` file extension may indicate a shared object being referred.
- The `strings` output for the `welcome` binary indicates that the string `greetings` is present in the `welcome` binary, which may indicate that the `greetings` binary in the same directory may be called by the `welcome` binary.
- Exploitation may be possible by creating a malicious `greetings` file, with commands to spawn a shell, which may then be spawned as a root user shell, during the execution of the `welcome` file, when the `greetings` file is called upon.
- `rm greetings`
- `cp /bin/bash greetings`
- `ls`
- `./welcome`
- Executing the `welcome` binary now spawns a root shell on our terminal screen.
- Root Shell
	- `id`
	- `whoami`
	- `cat /etc/shadow`
