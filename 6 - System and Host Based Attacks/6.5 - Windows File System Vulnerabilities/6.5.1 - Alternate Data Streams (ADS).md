- Alternate Data Streams (ADS), is an NTFS (New Technology File System) file attribute and was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS (Hierarchical File System).
- Any file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams:
	- Data Stream: Default stream that contains the data of the file.
	- Resource Stream: Typically contains the metadata of the file.
- Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files in order to evade detection.
- This can be done by storing the malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource stream (metadata) of a legitimate file.
- This technique is usually used to evade basic signature based AVs and static scanning tools.

Practical Demonstration
- Hiding text data in ADS:
	- `cd Desktop`
	- `notepad test.txt`
		- `Sample data`
	- `del test.txt`
	- `notepad test.txt:secret.txt`
		- `Hidden data`
	- `notepad test.txt`
		- `Visible data`
	- `type test.txt`
	- `type test.txt:secret.txt`
	- `del test.txt`
- Hiding executable files in ADS:
	- `cd /Temp`
	- In the demonstration we have an executable file for WinPEAS, named `payload.exe`, saved in the Temp directory.
	- `type payload.exe > windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe`
	- `del payload.exe`
	- `notepad windowslog.txt`
		- `Sample log data`
	- `start windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe`
	- Elevated Command Prompt:
		- `cd Windows\System32`
		- `mklink .\wupdate.exe C:\Temp\windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe`
		- `wupdate`
