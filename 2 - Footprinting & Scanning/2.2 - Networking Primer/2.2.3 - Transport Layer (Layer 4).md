- The Transport Layer plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between two devices on a network.
- The Transport Layer is responsible for providing end-to-end communication and ensuring the reliable and ordered delivery of data between two devices on a network.
- This Layer handles tasks like error detection, flow control, and segmentation of data into smaller units.

Transport Layer Protocols
	TCP
		- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data.
	UDP
		- User Datagram Protocol is a connection-less protocol that is faster, but provides no guarantee regarding the order or reliability of data.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
	- It is one of the main protocols operating at the Transport Layer of the OSI model.
	- It is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that provides a dependable and ordered delivery of data between two devices on a network.
	- TCP ensures that data sent from one application is received accurately and in the correct order by another application on the receiving device.
	- The ordered nature of data sent by TCP makes it a good choice for protocols like HTTP to be based on.
	Properties of TCP:
		- Connection Oriented: TCP established a connection between the sender and the receiver before any data is exchanged. The connection is a virtual circuit that ensures reliable and ordered data transfer.
		- Reliability: TCP guarantees reliable delivery of data, It achieves this through mechanisms such as acknowledgements (ACKs), and retransmission of lost or corrupted packets. If a segment of data is not acknowledged, TCP automatically resends the segment.
		- Ordered Data Transfer: TCP ensures that data is delivered in the correct order, if segments of data arrive out of order, TCP reorders them before passing them to the higher-layer application.

TCP 3-Way Handshake
	- The TCP three way handshake is a process used to establish a reliable connection between two devices before they begin data transmission.
	- It involves a series of three messages sent between the sender and the receiver.
	- The client initially sends a packet with the TCP SYN flag set, to express the intent to communicate with the server, the server will then take a look at the SYN flag, and if everything is right, it will respond back with a packet with a TCP ACK flag set.
	- The client will then have to send back a packet with the TCP ACK flag set, in order for the communication process to begin.

TCP Header Fields
	- Source Port (16 bits): Specifies the source port of the sender.
	- Destination Port (16 bits): Specifies the destination port of the receiver.
	TCP Control Flags
		- TCP Control Flags are a set of control flags used by TCP to manage the various aspects of the communication process.
		- These flags are included in the TCP header, and control different features during the establishment, maintenance and termination of the connection.
		- Establishing a connection:
			SYN (Set): Initiates a connection request
			ACK (Clear): No acknowledgement yet
			FIN (Clear): No termination request
		- Establishing a connection (Response):
			SYN (Set): Acknowledges the connection request
			ACK (Set): Acknowledges the received data
			FIN (Clear): No termination request
		- Terminating a connection:
			SYN (Clear): No connection request
			ACK (Set): Acknowledges the received data
			FIN (Set): Initiates connection termination
		- RST Flag: Resets the connection

Port Numbers
	- TCP uses port numbers to distinguish between different services or applications on a server.
	- Port numbers are 16-bit unsigned integers, and they are divided into three ranges.
	- The maximum port number in the TCP/IP protocol is 65,535
	Well Known Ports:
		- Well known ports, fall between the range of 0 to 1023, they are reserved for well known services and protocols. These are standardized by the Internet Assignment Numbers Authority (IANA).
		- Some Examples are: 80 (HTTP), 443(HTTPS), 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3)
	Registered Ports:
		- Ports number within the range of 1024 to 49151 are registered for specific services or applications, these are typically assigned by the IANA to software vendors or developers for their applications. While they are not standardized, they are often used for well known services.
		- Some Examples are: 3389 (RDP), 3306 (MySQL DB), 8080 (HTTP), 27017 (MongoDB)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
	- UDP is a connectionless and lightweight transport layer protocol that provides a simple and minimalistic way to transmit data between devices on a network.
	- UDP does not establish a connection before sending data and does not provide the same level of reliability and ordering guarantees, Instead, it focuses on simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for certain types of applications.
	Properties of UDP:
		- Connectionless: UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it does not establish a connection before sending data. Each UDP datagram is treated independently, and there is no persistent state maintained between the sender and the receiver.
		- Unreliable: UDP does not provide reliable delivery of data, it does not guarantee that packets will be delivered, and there is no mechanism for retransmission of lost packets. This lack of reliability makes UDP faster, but less suitable for applications that require guaranteed delivery.
		- Used for Real-Time applications: UDP is commonly used in real-time applications where low latency is crucial, such as audio and video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP communication.
		- Simple and Stateless: UDP is a stateless protocol, meaning that it does not maintain any state information about the communication.
		- Each UDP packet in transmission is independent of previous or future packets.

Practical Demonstration:
Netstat
	- `netstat -antp` is used to list active TCP connections, and their PIDs, and program names.
	- `netstat -ano` is the similar command, but with flags set according to the windows standard for the tool.
	- TLS is a session layer protocol, it can be used on top of TCP.
