- The Network Layer, is responsible for logical addressing, routing and forwarding data packets between devices across different networks.
- Its primary goal is to determine the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the destination, even if the devices are on separate networks.
- The network layer abstracts the underlying physical network, allowing for the creation of a cohesive internetwork.
- The Internet is made possible mainly due to the Network Layer's functioning.

Network Layer Protocols
	Internet Protocol
		- IPV4 is the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol. It has 32-bit addresses, and provides the foundation for communication over the internet.
		- IPV6 has been developed to address the limitations of IPV4, It utilizes 128 bit IP addresses, and allows for an exponentially larger address space.
	ICMP
		- The Internet Control Message Protocol, is mainly used for error reporting and diagnostics. ICMP includes ping (echo request and echo reply), traceroute and various error messages.
		- ICMP is mainly used to check if a host is up.

Internet Protocol
	- The Internet Protocol is a central protocol in the suite of protocols that form the foundation of the Internet.
	- It operates on the Network Layer (Layer 3 of the OSI Model), and is responsible for logical addressing, routing and the fragmentation and reassembly of data packets. 
	- IP enables communication between devices on different networks by providing a standardized way to identify and locate hosts.

Internet Protocol Version
	IPV4
		- IPV4 addresses are represented with 32-bit addresses as 4 sets of octets.
		- IPV4 addresses provide a finite address space, which has led to the adoption of IPV6 to address the exhaustion of available IPV4 addresses.
	IPV6
		- IPV6 was developed to overcome the limitations of IPV4 and provide a significantly larger address space by using 128-bit addresses.
		- IPV6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal notations.

Internet Protocol Functionality
	Logical Addressing
		- IP addresses serve as a logical address assigned to a network interface. The addresses are usually used to identify each device on a network.
		- IP addresses are hierarchical and structured based on network classes, subnets, and CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing) notation.
	Packet Structure
		- IP organizes data into packets for transmission across networks, each packet consists of a header and a payload.
		- The header contains essential information including the source and destination IP addresses, IP version number, Time to Live (TTL), and protocol type.
	Fragmentation and Reassembly
		- IP allows for the fragmentation of large packets into smaller fragments when traversing networks with varying Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes.
		- The receiving host reassembles these fragments to reconstruct the original packet.
	IP Addressing Types
		- IP addresses can be classified into three types:
			- unicast (one-to-one communication)
			- broadcast (one-to-all communication within a subnet)
			- multicast (one-to-many communication to a selected group of devices)
	Subnetting
		- Subnetting is a technique that divides a large IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks.
		- It enhances efficiency and security.
	Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
		- ICMP is closely associated with IP and is used for error reporting and diagnostics, common ICMP messages include echo request and echo reply, which are used in the ping utility.
	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
		- DHCP is often used in conjunction with IP to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network, simplifying the process of network configuration.
		- Before DHCP, one needed to manually assign available IP addresses to the required host.

Internet Protocol Structure
	Header Format
		- The IP protocol defines many different fields in the packet header. These fields contain binary values that the IPV4 services refer as they forward packets across the network.
			- Version (4 bits): This indicates the version of the IP protocol being used. For IPV4, the value being represented would be 4.
			- Header Length (4 bits): Specifies the length of the IPV4 header in 32-bit words. The minimum value is 5, indicating a 20-byte header, and the maximum value is 15, indicating a 60-byte header.
			- Type of Service (ToS) (8 bits):  Originally designed for specifying the quality of service, it includes fields such as Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to manage the packet priority and congestion control.
			- Total Length (16 bits): It represents the total size of the IP packet, including both the header and the payload (data), The maximum size is 65,535 bytes. In case the size, exceeds the maximum size, it is broken down by the process of fragmentation.
			- Identification (16 bits): Used for reassembling the fragmented packet. Each fragment of a packet is assigned the same identification value.
			- Flags (3 bits): Includes three flags related to packet fragmentation:
				- Reserved (bit 0): Always set to 0
				- Don't Fragment (DF, bit 1): If set to 1, indicates that the packet should not be fragmented.
				- More Fragments (MF, bit 2): If set to 1, indicates that more fragments follow in a fragmented packet
			- Time-to-Live (TTL) (8 bits): Represents the maximum number of hops (routers) a packet can traverse before being discarded. It is decremented by 1 at each hop.
			- Protocol (8 bits): Identifies the higher-layer protocol that will receive the packet after IP processing, common values include 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP. and 1 for ICMP.
			- Source IP Address (32 bits): Specifies the IPV4 address of the source of the packet.
			- Destination IP Address (32 bits): Specifies the IPV4 address of the intended recipient.

Representation of IPV4 Addresses
	IPV4
		- The vast majority of networks run IPV4.
		- An IPV4 address consists of four bytes, or octets, a byte consists of 8 bits.
		- Example Address: 73.5.12.132
		- A dot delimits every octet in an IPV4 address.
	Reserved IPV4 Addresses:
		- 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255: Represents the current network.
		- 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255: Represents the local host.
		- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255: Reserved for private networks.
