Phases involved in a penetration test:
	- Information Gathering - Gathering information about the target systems, services and networks
	- Enumeration - Assessing useful information from the services running on open ports on active hosts
	- Exploitation (Initial Access) - Assessing vulnerabilities present within the system, and viable vulns to pursue by threat modelling, and then modifying or using the exploit for the vulnerabilities present for the process of exploitation
	- Post Exploitation - Includes local enumeration, privilege escalation, persistence, evade defense systems, and pivoting
	- Reporting - In reporting, results of the pentest are provided to the client in a neat, comprehensible manner

Active Information Gathering involves:
	- Network Mapping - Understanding the topology of the network you are connected to
	- Host Discovery - Involves mapping the active hosts in the given network or subnet
	- Port Scanning
	- Service and OS Detection

Active Information Gathering in the context of pen-testing, refers to the phase where the tester actively interacts with the target system or network to collect data and identify possible vulnerabilities. Passive information gathering on the other hand includes gathering information without interacting with the target entities.
