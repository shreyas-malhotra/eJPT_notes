- Service version and OS detection is important as it feeds into the Vulnerability Assessment phase of the penetration test

Nmap Service Version Detection
	- The `-sV` flag in Nmap can be used to perform service version detection.
	- In case Nmap is not providing accurate results for the service version scan, we can adjust the `--version-intensity` parameter to go along with the `-sV` flag.
	- The `--version-intensity` parameter can be assigned a numeric value from 0 to 9.
	- Higher values ensure that whatever service versions are being enumerated are being detected as accurately as possible.
	- Usage Example: `nmap -sV --version-intensity 8 -p- 10.10.0.1`

Nmap OS Detection
	- The `-O` flag in Nmap can be used to perform OS version detection.
	- Usage Example: `nmap -O -p- 10.10.0.1`
	- Nmap may not be able to provide the OS version of the target host accurately in some scenarios, in this case we can try to use the TCP/IP fingerprint provided in the result of the OS detection scan to somewhat ascertain what OS is running on the target host, or fine tune our scanning parameters as demonstrated below.
	- Alternatively, we can also fine tune our scanning parameters to perform a more aggressive OS detection scan using the `--osscan-guess` parameter, this may provide us with the kernel version of the target's operating system in case of Linux, or  the Windows version in case of Windows.
	- Usage Example: `nmap -sV -O --osscan-guess -p- 10.10.0.1`
	- We can also use the Nmap Scripting Engine to perform better OS version detection, Nmap Scripting Engine will be covered in the next section.
