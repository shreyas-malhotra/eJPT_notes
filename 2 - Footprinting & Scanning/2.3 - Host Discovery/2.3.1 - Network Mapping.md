Network Mapping
	- Network mapping refers to the process of discovering and identifying devices, and network infrastructure elements and layout within a target network.
	- The main goal of Network Mapping is to identify potential entry points for further exploitation.
	- Network Mapping helps us determine the following:
		- What hosts, within an in-scope network are online?
		- What ports are open on the active hosts?
		- What operating systems are running on the active hosts?
	- Network Mapping can also help us determine the purpose of the network.

Example
	- In scope: 200.200.0.0/16
	- A 16 bit netmask means the network could contain up to 2^16 hosts, with IP addresses in the 200.200.0.0 - 200.200.255.255 range.
	- The first job here is to determine which of the 65,536 IP addresses are assigned to a host, and which of those hosts are active.

Network Mapping Objectives
	- Discovery of Live Hosts: Identifying active devices and hosts on the network, and the IP addresses they are currently using.
	- Identification of Open Ports and Services: Determining which ports are open on the discovered hosts, and identifying the services running on those ports. This information helps pen-testers understand the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
	- Network Topology Mapping: Creating a diagram of the network topology, include routers, switches, firewalls and other networking equipment, may help in understanding the layout of the network and planning further pen-testing activities.
	- Operating System Fingerprinting: Determining the OS running on discovered hosts, since knowing them helps pen-testers tailor their attack strategies to target vulnerabilities specific to the known OS.
	- Service Version Detection: Identifying specific versions of services running on open ports, help in pinpointing vulnerabilities present in particular service versions.
	- Identifying Filtering and Security Measures: Discovering firewalls, IDSs, IPSs, and other security measures in place, helps pen-testers understand the network's defenses and plan their approach accordingly
	- All of this feeds into the Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation phase of the pentest
