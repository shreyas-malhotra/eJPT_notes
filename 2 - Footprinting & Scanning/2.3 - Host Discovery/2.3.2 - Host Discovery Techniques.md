Host Discovery
	- Host Discovery is a crucial phase, to identify live hosts on a network before further exploitation.
	- The choice of technique employed in Host Discovery depends on a variety of factors like:
		- Network Characteristics
		- Stealth Requirements
		- Pentest Goals

Host Discovery Techniques
	Ping Sweeps
		- Ping Sweeps refer to sending ICMP echo requests (ping requests) to a range of IP addresses, to identify live hosts on the network.
		- Windows Firewalls by default block ICMP echo requests, so relying solely on this technique is not recommendable.
		- Pros: ICMP Ping is widely supported and a quick method for identifying live hosts.
		- Cons: Some hosts or firewalls may be configured to block ICMP traffic, limiting its effectiveness, ICMP pings can also be easily detected.
	ARP Scanning
		- It involves sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to identify hosts on a local network.
		- ARP scanning is effective in discovering hosts within the same broadcast scan.
	TCP SYN Ping (Half-Open Scan)
		- Sending TCP SYN packets to a specific port (often port 80), to check if a host is alive.
		- If the host is alive, it responds with a TCP SYN-ACK packet.
		- This technique is stealthier and faster than ICMP ping, as well as TCP Connect scans.
		- Custom ports can be specified for a TCP SYN Ping scan.
		- Pros: TCP SYN ping is stealthier than ICMP and may bypass firewalls that allow outbound connections.
		- Cons: Some hosts may not respond to TCP SYN requests, and the result can be affected by firewalls and security devices. (It can only be conducted on open ports, so if the port is closed, the TCP SYN Ping scan may report that the host is inactive, even if it may be active.)
	UDP Ping
		- Sending UDP packets to a specific port to check if a host is alive.
		- This can be effective for hosts that do not respond to ICMP or TCP probes.
	TCP ACK Ping
		- Sending TCP ACK packets to a specific port to check if a host is alive.
		- This technique expects no response, but if a TCP RST (reset) is received, it indicates the host is alive.
	TCP SYN-ACK Ping
		- Sending TCP SYN-ACK packets to a specific port to check if a host is alive.
		- If a TCP RST is received, it indicates that the host is alive.

- The choice of the technique to be implemented is not definitive, it depends on various factors, and there is not a one-size fits all answer.
- The effectiveness of a host discovery technique can be influenced by:
	- The specific characteristics of the target network
	- The security controls in place
	- The goals of the penetration test
