- Syntax: `nmap <scan options> <target>`
- Certain Nmap scan options require sudo/root privileges depending on the type of packets they are sending.
- It is important to understand the nuance of the scan options in Nmap, and how using them affects the accuracy of your host discovery scans.
- Some networks may have firewalls in place, and one needs to factor the common rules setup on these firewalls to perform effective host discovery. For example, the firewalls may be blocking ICMP echo requests, SYN requests, RST packets etc.
- Documentation on Nmap can be found by either using the `-h` flag or the manual page for Nmap, which can be brought up using `man nmap`.
- Nmap is more biased to representing an online host as offline, instead of the other way around.
- DNS Resolution can be disabled using the `-n` option, and enabled for all hosts, including the offline ones, using the `-R` option.

Specifying targets to scan in Nmap
	Specifying targets on the command-line:
		- `nmap -sn 10.10.0.1`
		- `nmap -sn 10.10.0.0/24`
		- `nmap -sn 10.10.0.1 10.10.0.2`
		- `nmap -sn 10.10.0.1-10`
	Specifying targets using an input file (with file syntax as displayed in the image above):
		- `nmap -sn -iL input.txt`

Nmap Ping Scan (`-sn`)
	- Examples: `nmap -sn 10.10.0.1`, `nmap -sn --send-ip 10.10.0.1`
	- `-sn`/Ping Scan: The default host discovery done with the `-sn` option consists of sending ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN requests (to port 443), and TCP ACK requests (to port 80), and an ICMP timestamp request.
	- Although, when running on a local ethernet network, the Nmap Ping Scan `-sn`, will utilize the ARP protocol to perform host discovery, instead of the default method described above.
	- In order to override this behavior of Nmap on local ethernet networks, we can use the `-sn` scan option, with the `--send-ip` flag along with it, which results in ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN, and TCP ACK flags being sent, as is generally done so, along with the ARP requests.
	- Ping scans can be combined with other host discovery types or options in Nmap to override the default configuration of ports to be scanned with custom port specifications.
	- Custom port configurations along with the `-sn` scans on local ethernet networks, allow us to conduct a host discovery scan without utilizing ICMP requests, but while explicitly sending TCP packets to specific ports, to analyze the responses that we get back.

TCP SYN Ping (`-sn -PS`)
	- Example: `nmap -sn -PS 10.10.0.1`, `nmap -sn -PS22 10.10.0.1`, `nmap -sn -PS1-1000 10.10.0.1`, `nmap -sn -PS3389 10.10.0.1`, `nmap -sn -PS22,80,3389`
	- The TCP SYN ping is generally considered to be the most accurate scan to perform during the Host Discovery phase.
	- The TCP SYN ping uses the `-sn` flag to indicate that port scanning is disabled, but then the `-PS` flag is used to override the default `-sn` scan configuration, and specify that only a TCP SYN packet needs to be sent.
	- The TCP SYN Ping by default sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80 on the target system, if the port is closed, the host responds with a RST packet.
	- If the port is open, the host responds with a TCP SYN/ACK packet, indicating that a connection can be established. After the host sends back the TCP SYN/ACK packet, the attack box sends the target a RST packet to reset the connection.
	- If no response is received back, the host may be considered by Nmap to be offline.
	- In some cases, a firewall may be blocking TCP RST requests, as such one may need to specify custom ports on the host to send the probes to, as in the third usage example command.
	- To specify a custom port in a TCP SYN Ping scan, we can append the port number along with the `-PS` flag, as demonstrated in the second and third usage example command, or try specifying ports that are generally open on specific operating systems, like port 3389 for RDP on Windows.
	- Multiple ports can be specified together without using a range, using the syntax mentioned in usage example four.
	- This is essentially a way to perform port scanning on a limited set of ports, or a specific port, to tell if a host is online.
	- If the `-sn` flag is omitted along with the TCP SYN ping, a port scan will be performed, irrespective of the ports specified along with the -PS option, instead of a TCP SYN ping, which will take up significantly more time, and should be avoided during the Host Discovery phase.

TCP ACK Ping (`-sn -PA`)
	- Example: `nmap -sn -PA 10.10.0.1`
	- The TCP ACK Ping by default sends a TCP ACK packet to port 80 on the target system.
	- If the host is offline during the probe, there would be no response to the ping request.
	- If the host is active, the host responds with a RST packet, which is the general response procedure towards malformed requests.
	- In certain cases, hosts, operating systems or network environments may be configured to block malformed TCP ACK packets, and as such TCP ACK ping scan is not generally considered as accurate as the TCP SYN ping scan, for Host Discovery.
	- TCP ACK scans may come in handy when figuring out if there is indeed a firewall present in the network, or not. If we already know that the host is online, and it is blocking TCP ACK ping scans, it can be an indication of a firewall being present on the network.

ICMP Specific Ping Scan (`nmap -sn -PE --send-ip`)
	- ICMP Specific Ping Scans are just used to only send ICMP echo requests to the target host.
	- The `--send-ip` flag is generally used to perform the scan on local ethernet networks, in which scenario Nmap might just be performing an ARP scan instead, similar to the Nmap `-sn` scan described at the beginning of this page.
	- The TCP SYN Ping scan is preferable over the ICMP Specific Ping Scan, since Windows hosts are known to block ICMP echo requests.

UDP Ping (`-sn -PU`)
	 - In case we need to perform Host Discovery on UDP ports, we can perform a UDP Ping scan using the `-sn -PU` flags.

Host Discovery Methodology
	- Nmap Ping Scan: `nmap -sn -v -T4 10.10.0.1`
	- TCP SYN Ping Scan: `nmap -sn -PS21,22,25,80,445,3389,8080 -T4 10.10.0.1`
	- UDP Ping Scan: `nmap -sn -PU137,138 -T4 10.10.0.1`
