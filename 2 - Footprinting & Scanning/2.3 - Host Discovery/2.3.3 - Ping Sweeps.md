- Ping Sweeps are a network scanning technique that is used to discover live hosts, within a specific ip address range, or a network.
- The basic idea is to send a series of ICMP echo requests (ping) messages to a range of IP addresses and observe the response to determine which addresses are active or reachable.

Ping command
	- Example (single host): `ping 192.168.1.5`
	- Ping is a utility designed to check if a host is alive/reachable.
	- It is available on every major operating systems, and can be invoked in the command line by using the command as mentioned in the example.
	- If the host is online, it will respond with an ICMP echo response, as shown in the image above.
	- Ping also resolves a domain name to an IP address before sending the ICMP echo request, with the bytes taken, latency of the response and TTL.
	- ICMP echo scans are unreliable if the environment we are looking to perform Host Discovery on has Windows hosts, since they block ICMP requests by default.

Ping sweeps
	- Ping sweeps work by sending one or more specially crafted ICMP packets (Type 8 - echo request) to a host.
	- If the destination host replies with an ICMP echo reply (Type 0) packet, then the host is alive/online.
	- In the context of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), the ICMP echo request and echo reply messages are used for the purpose of ping. These messages have specific ICMP type and code values associated with them.

Ping Request/Response Structure:
	- ICMP Echo Request Structure:
		 - Type: 8
		 - Code: 0
	 - ICMP Echo Reply Structure:
		 - Type: 0
		 - Code: 0
	- The "Type" field in the ICMP header indicates the purpose or function of the ICMP message, and the "Code" field provides additional context related to the message type.
	- In the case of ICMP echo request and echo reply, the Type value 8 represents echo request, and the Type value 0 represents echo reply
	- So, when a device sends an ICMP echo request, it creates an ICMP packet with Type 8, Code 0.
	- When the destination device receives the echo request and responds with an echo reply, it creates an ICMP packet with Type 0, Code 0.
	- When the host is offline or not reachable, the ICMP echo request message sent by the ping utility will not receive a corresponding ICMP echo reply.
	- The absence of a response doesn't necessarily indicate that the host is permanently offline, it could be due to various reasons like:
		- Network congestion
		- Temporary unavailability
		- Firewall settings that block ICMP traffic
	- The ping utility provides a quick and simple way to check the reachability of a host, but it's important to interpret the results in the context of network conditions and the host configuration.

Practical Demonstration using ping and fping
	Wireshark
		- `sudo wireshark` to capture network traffic on the network interface being used to send the ping requests.
	ping
		- Example: `ping 10.4.31.111`
		- Linux command with the `-c` flag to specify the number of ICMP echo request packets to send: `ping -c 5 10.4.31.111`
		- Windows command with the `-n` flag to specify the number of ICMP echo request packets to send: `ping -n 5 10.4.31.111`
		- No reply in the demonstration could be due to:
			- Host being offline
			- Host being configured to deny ICMP echo requests
			- Host being behind a Firewall that denies ICMP echo requests
		- If we want to ping sweep the whole subnet:
			- `ping -c 1 10.10.23.0`, since the netmask is `255.255.255.0`
			- If the network is a broadcast network, we also need to use the `-b` flag.
	- fping
		- fping is an advancement of the ping utility.
		- Example: `fping -a -g 10.10.23.0/24`
		- The `-a` flag is used to show targets that are alive.
		- The `-A` flag is used to show target by their addresses.
		- The `-g` flag is used to generate a target list, if no `-f` option is specified, essentially allows us to specify the subnet to scan using CIDR notation.
		- The `-S` flag is used to spoof the IP Address for the source of the ICMP echo requests, could be helpful for stealth.
		- `fping -a -g 10.10.23.0/24 2>dev/null` will remove the error messages from the result of the fping command, and only provide the ip addresses of the hosts that are active.
	Nmap
		- `nmap -Pn 10.4.31.111` will finally result in an accurate result, i.e. the host is active, since it skips the host discovery phase and directly performs port scanning on the target host.
		- `nmap -sn 10.4.31.111` on the other hand, will not show the correct result, it will show that the host is inactive, because it is just used to perform a host discovery scan using Nmap, while disabling the port scanning functionality, which we utilized to discover windows hosts in this scenario.
